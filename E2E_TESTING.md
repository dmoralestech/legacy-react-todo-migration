# E2E Testing Guide

This document explains the end-to-end (E2E) testing setup for the Legacy TODO App.

## Available Commands

### ✅ Working Commands

| Command | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `npm run test:e2e:basic` | Run basic functionality tests (all browsers) | ✅ All 30 tests pass |
| `npm run test:e2e:basic:chromium` | Run basic functionality tests (Chromium only) | ✅ All 10 tests pass |
| `npm run test:e2e:chromium` | Run all E2E tests (Chromium only) | ⚠️ 18/20 tests pass |
| `npm run test:e2e:headed` | Run tests with visible browser | ✅ Works |

### ⚠️ Partial/Issue Commands

| Command | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run all E2E tests (all browsers) | ⚠️ Some tests fail |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Run tests with Playwright UI | ❌ UI framework error |

## Test Categories

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests (`basic-functionality.spec.js`)
**Status: ✅ All 10 tests passing**

Tests that verify core app functionality without relying on data persistence:
- App loading and title verification
- Form display and interaction
- Empty state handling
- Form submission (button and Enter key)
- Input validation
- Filter button presence
- Keyboard navigation
- JavaScript error detection
- Responsive design

### 2. Advanced Feature Tests (`todo-app.spec.js`)
**Status: ⚠️ 8/10 tests passing**

Tests that attempt full CRUD operations but fail due to mock API limitations:
- ✅ App title and header display
- ✅ Form functionality
- ✅ Form submission
- ✅ Filter button clicks
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Delete operations
- ✅ Error detection
- ❌ Todo count display (data doesn't persist)
- ❌ Edit operations (data doesn't persist)

## Why Some Tests Fail

The legacy TODO app uses mock API calls that don't persist data in the browser environment. This is expected behavior for a demo application. The failing tests expect:

1. **Data Persistence**: Todos to remain after being added
2. **State Updates**: Todo counts to update correctly
3. **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality

These limitations are by design for this legacy demonstration app.

## Recommended Usage

For CI/CD and development verification, use:

```bash
# Fast, reliable basic functionality check
npm run test:e2e:basic:chromium

# Full verification (with expected failures)
npm run test:e2e:chromium
```

For local development and debugging:

```bash
# Visual testing with browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Specific test file
npx playwright test src/test/e2e/basic-functionality.spec.js --headed
```

## Browser Support

- ✅ **Chromium** - Fully tested and working
- ✅ **Firefox** - Basic tests pass
- ✅ **Webkit** - Basic tests pass

## Test Configuration

Tests are configured in `playwright.config.js`:
- Test directory: `src/test/e2e/`
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Automatically starts development server
- 30-second timeout for individual tests
- HTML report generation

## Troubleshooting

### If E2E tests won't start:
```bash
npx playwright install
```

### If development server won't start:
```bash
npm start
# Wait for server to be ready, then run tests in another terminal
```

### For debugging specific tests:
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```
